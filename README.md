Objective: Create a web app which uses a search input and Giphy's API to display giphs on a page.

It should be able to do the following:

    Display trending gifs on app load and display them in a grid
    Has search functionality for more specific gifs
    Has a load more button at the bottom of the page which displays more results

About:

It is a React app with Chakra UI for the styling.

Thoughts:

I really like the simple animation of Giphys page, didnt have time to deep dive into recreating that! I also learned there was such a thing as masonry layout, pretty cool
but also didnt have time to deep dive into that! Overall I quite enjoyed making this, was good to come back and start from scratch again with Chakra since I am a lot more familiar now this is the 3rd project I have done with it. I really like some elements but I am still not fully convinced and I think I'll try a few other things out like bootstrap or tailwind just for a few comparisons of other styling techniques.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
