# <p align="center">Introduction </p>

This was a challenge set in an interview that I really enjoyed and was a culmination of lots of tutorials and advancement from some of my previous projects. I really tried to apply the DRY principle throughout this and keep my code as clean and simple as possible. Then I came back and further refined it to include as a simple portfolio project. I tried to ensure it was full accessible and hunted down the object response from giphy to try and find the image source to keep the site running fast. (There is A LOT of data and image types in that response!) I really liked their styling, the masonry grid display is something I want to learn and just the shimmering background and things is also something I went into and looked at, their site is very simple but very nice.

### <p align="center">React

Highly popular for a reason and no need to reinvent the wheel here.

### <p align="center">Chakra UI

Something I had used a couple of times by this point, it was really nice to start from scratch and fully utilise it being able to keep my styling clean and simple and make proper use of my theme file.
